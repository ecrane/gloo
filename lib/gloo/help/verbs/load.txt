LOAD VERB
  NAME: load
  SHORTCUT: <

  DESCRIPTION
    Load an object file.
    There are two ways to specify the file.  Give either the full path
    and file name or use a relative path from the gloo project folder.
    For the latter, the extension is not needed.  For the former, the
    file extension is necessary.
    
    Using * instead of a file name will load all gloo files in the folder.

  SYNTAX
    load <file_name>

  PARAMETERS
    file_name - Name of the object file that is to be loaded.

  RESULT
    Objects are loaded into the heap.
    on_load scripts are run within the loaded objects.

  ERRORS
    Missing Expression!
      - No expression is provided as parameter to the verb.

    If the file specified can't be found or can't be loaded,
    an error condition will result.
