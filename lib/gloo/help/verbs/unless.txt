UNLESS VERB
  NAME: unless
  SHORTCUT: if!

  DESCRIPTION
    Unless an expression is true, do something.
    This is the opposite of the if verb.

  SYNTAX
    unless <true> do <command>

  PARAMETERS
    true - Does the expression evaluate to true?
    command - Execute command if the expression is not true.

  RESULT
    Unchanged if the expression is true.
    If not true, then the result will be based on the command
    specified after the 'do' keyword.

  ERRORS
    Missing Expression!
      - No expression is provided as parameter to the verb.

    Other errors depend on the command that is run.
