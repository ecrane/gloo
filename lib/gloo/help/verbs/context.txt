CONTEXT VERB
  NAME: context
  SHORTCUT: @

  DESCRIPTION
    Get or set the current context.
    When no parameter is provided, the context will be shown.
    The the optional path parameter is provided, the context will
    be set to that path.
    Use 'context root' to set the context back to the root level.

  SYNTAX
    context <path.to.new.context>

  PARAMETERS
    path.to.new.context - Optional.  The path to the new context.

  RESULT
    Context is optionally set.
    <it> will be set to the new context path when we are changing context.
    Context is show in either case.

  ERRORS
    None

    Note that providing a context does not exist will not initially
    be a problem.  In other words, you can set the context to an
    object before it exists.  However use of context that doesn't exist
    will be a problem.

  EXAMPLE

    > context
      Context: root

    > context my.object.path
      Context: my.object.path

    > context root
      Context: root
