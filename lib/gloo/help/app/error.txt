ERROR

  DESCRIPTION
    Gloo has a special 'error' variable that's not part of the normal
    object heap.  The error will be empty most of the time, but
    if a command results in an error, this variable will hold the
    error message until the next command is executed.  The error
    is a string and can be accessed by simply referring to the
    path-name 'error'.

  EXAMPLE
    To see the last error:

      > show error

    To run a command that generates an error:

      > put 3 into
      'put' must include 'into' target

    Then, showing the error

      > show error
      'put' must include 'into' target

    But, as mentioned, the next command will clear out the last error.
    If you need to keep track of the result of a command, you should
    put the error into another object.

      > create err as string
      > put 3 into
      > put error into err
