EVENTS

  DESCRIPTION
    Scripts can be written to be triggered by events.  The current list is as
    follows, but it is expected that the list of events will grow.

      on_load - run when a script loads
      on_unload - run when an object receives an unload message

      TODO:  add event types.

  EXAMPLE
    Show a message when a file is loaded:

      start [container] :
        on_load [script] : show "Welcome back!" (white)

    Show a message when a file unloaded:

      done [container] :
        on_unload [script] : show "See ya soon!" (white)
