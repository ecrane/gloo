PATHNAME

  DESCRIPTION
    All gloo object data and scripts are stored in a heap of objects or
    just "the heap".  The heap is hierarchical, with some objects having
    children objects.  To reference an object, we use a "pathname".  The
    pathname starts with the root level object then has a period, ".",
    then the child object name, and so forth.  "a.b.c" refers to the "c"
    object in the "b" container, which is in the "a" container.

  ROOT
    The word "root" is not needed when referring to objects.  In some
    special cases, "root" can be used to point to the first level of
    the object heap.  One such use would be with the "context" verb.

  EXAMPLE
    Here is an example of objects and a pathname reference to an
    object within the hierarchy:

      #
      # Hierarchical containers.
      #
      a [can] :
        b [can] :
          c [string] : Hello World
      on_load [script] : show a.b.c
