GLOO SYSTEM OBJECTS

  DESCRIPTION
    The gloo system objects are virtual objects.  That is that they
    can be accessed like other objects.  But the values are set by
    the system.  The values cannot be updated.  The other difference
    is that the virtual objects do not show up in the object heap.

  ACCESS
    The gloo objects can be accessed through the 'gloo' root level
    virtual object designation.  There is also a shortcut for the virtual
    object path:  '$'.  For example, to see the current user:

      > show gloo.user

    Or:

      > show $.user

    Some objects include an '_' to separate words.  As an alternative,
    a '.' can be used instead.  The following commands are treated as
    identical:

      > show gloo.working_dir
      > show gloo.working.dir
      > show $.working_dir
      > show $.working.dir
