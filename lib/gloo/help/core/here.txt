HERE

  DESCRIPTION
    Gloo scripts can use relative referencing to access objects
    without specifying the full path.  This relative referencing is
    referred to with the 'here' operator: ^

  EXAMPLE
    In the following script, the here reference is used several times:

      #
      # Use here reference.
      #
      here [can] :
        s [str] : local string
      	on_load [script] : show ^.s
        a [can] :
          s [str] : A string
          b [can] :
            s [str] : B string
            on_load [script] :
              show ^.s
              show ^^.s

    A single use of '^' means: refer to an object at the same level
    as the running script.  It tells the interpreter to 'look here'
    for the object.

    Use of two ^^ here references means to go up a level, and
    so forth.
