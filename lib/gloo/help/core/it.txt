IT

  DESCRIPTION
    'It' is a special virtual object.  'It' contains the value of
    the last expression or command run.  Not all commands result in
    a change to the value of it.

  EXAMPLE
    Get the value of an expression and store it somewhere for later use:

      #
      # Example of usage of 'it'.
      #
      it_example [can] :
        result [int] :
        on_load [script] :
          show 3 + 4
          put it into ^.result
          show ^.result

    Running this script will show 7 twice.  The first time will be the
    result of the addition.  The second time will be showing the
    result object.
